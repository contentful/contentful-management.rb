### Changed

## 1.0.0
### Breaking Changes
* `Client` is no longer a singleton. Therefore all `Resource` class calls (`Entry`, `Space`, `ContentType`, etc...) require an instance of a client.
  The Client needs to be the first parameter of the call. As sending the client in every call is not a great solution, a shorthand for every resource
  class is present on the client. Calls can be done now like: `client.entries.all`. This works for every resource class, and all of the calls existing previously
  (`all`, `find`, `create`, `all_published`). **Note: `all_published` is specific to `Entry`, `Asset` and `ContentType`**.
* You can have as many instances of client, for as many users as you want.

Complete List of resource links on `Client`:
* `#entries`
* `#assets`
* `#spaces`
* `#content_types`
* `#locales`
* `#webhooks`
* `#api_keys`
