### Changed

**BREAKING CHANGES**:
* In order to provide a better top-level client API, `space_id` and `environment_id`, are now sent on the resource proxy call, rather than on the call itself. This allows for better reusability of proxies, which in the end provide a better developer experience.
Resources that are not environment-aware, still have the parameter arrangement changed, so proxies are also reusable, but do not include `environment_id`.
The `spaces`, `users`, `organizations` and `personal_access_tokens` proxies still do not require any parameters as they are top level resources.

Before (this code will assume that the old code was also environment aware, so that the impact is more visible):

```ruby
# Fetching all entries
client.entries.all(space_id, environment_id)

# Fetching a single entry
client.entries.find(space_id, environment_id, entry_id)

# If you wanted to find another entry, you'd have to repeat `space_id` and `environment_id`
client.entries.find(space_id, environment_id, another_entry_id)
```

Now:

```ruby
# Fetching all entries
client.entries(space_id, environment_id).all

# Fetching a single entry
entries_proxy = client.entries(space_id, environment_id)
entries_proxy.find(entry_id)

# If you wanted to find another entry, you just reuse the resource proxy
entries_proxy.find(another_entry_id)
```

The proxies, apart from the parameter re-shuffling, have kept the same interface.

* Spaces do no longer have proxies for `entries`, `assets`, `content_types`, `ui_extensions`, `locales` and `editor_interfaces`. These can now be found under `environments`.
* Space objects now have `environments` as a proxy accessor.
* Content Type Caching is now done when requesting Content Types, or when a property is missing on an Entry. Also `dynamic_entries` has been updated to receive a hash of `space_id => environment_id` pairs.

### Removed

* `all_published` methods for Entries and Assets have been removed.

## 1.0.1
### Changed
* Changed locale selection priority when requesting fields [#91](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-management.rb/issues/91)

## 1.0.0
### Breaking Changes
* `Client` is no longer a singleton. Therefore all `Resource` class calls (`Entry`, `Space`, `ContentType`, etc...) require an instance of a client.
  The Client needs to be the first parameter of the call. As sending the client in every call is not a great solution, a shorthand for every resource
  class is present on the client. Calls can be done now like: `client.entries.all`. This works for every resource class, and all of the calls existing previously
  (`all`, `find`, `create`, `all_published`). **Note: `all_published` is specific to `Entry`, `Asset` and `ContentType`**.
* You can have as many instances of client, for as many users as you want.

Complete List of resource links on `Client`:
* `#entries`
* `#assets`
* `#spaces`
* `#content_types`
* `#locales`
* `#webhooks`
* `#api_keys`
